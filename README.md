## What is File compression?

file compression reduces the size of files by encoding their data more efficiently.  
This is expecially useful for backup, storage and file transfer.

### Compress file

- To compression a file : ```gzip filename```
- To decompress a file: ```gunzip filename.tar.gz```

### Compress Directory

- Creating a tar archive : ```tar -cvf folder_output.tar foldername/```
- Compressing the tar archive with gzip : ```gzip folder_output.tar```
- compressing a tar.gz archive in single command : ```tar -czvf folder_output.tar.gz foldername/```
- Decompressing a tar.gz archive in single command : ```tar -xzvf folder_output.tar.gz foldername/```
- Decompressing a tar.bz2 archive : ```tar -xjvf filename.tar.bz2```
